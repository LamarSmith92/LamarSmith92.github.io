  Lamar's First Personal Website

My project is made up of three column div's and space galaxy art for the background. In the div columns I listed projects, upcoming events, and a summary about me.

At the very top of the page I created a three link nav bar with dropdown access for the contact section.




Credits: wdi class 36 for giving me tips and sharing different ideas.
